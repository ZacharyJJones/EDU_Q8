class notes adv data structures

Class 01
---

2 types of data structure: linear and non-linear
- Linear is arrays, linked lists, etc
- Nonlinear is trees / heaps
>> Good way to remember is: is it obvious how this would be traversed when using a for loop to iterate over the data structure?
 >> arrays it is obvious
 >> trees... there are a variety of traversal options


"Abstract Data Types" as a concept, dynamic memory location (when array/list items do not have to be defined)


How to create the data types using python:

```
import ctypes # helps with dll calls or outside code?

class CustomList:

	# constructor
	def __init__(self):
		self.size = 1
		self.n = 0
		self.A = self.__make_array(self.size)
		pass

	def __len__(self):
		return self.n
		
	def __resize(self, newSpaces):
		pass
	
	def __delitem__(self, position):
		if 0 <= position < self.n:
			for i in range(position, self.n - 1):
				self.A[i] = self.A[i+1]
	
	def find(self, item):
		for i in range(self.n):
			if self.A[i] == item:
				return i
		return "ValueError - Not In List"
