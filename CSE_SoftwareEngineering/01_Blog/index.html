        I've never been happier to be the first successful fully cybernetically-augmented human!
      </p>
      <p>
        It's all thanks to OsCorp, who replaced my torso with a glider unit, my legs with thrusters and my arms with
        atmospheric attitude adjustment devices!
      </p>

        I've been hearing whispers through my ultrasonic detectors that I'll be employed shortly to escort a VIP through
        the ruined cityscape in the next few days. Exciting! I really hope we don't run into that public menace,
        arthropod-man.

        I was born today. The fact that I was able to create a website in the super cool hypertext markup language which
        released in version 4.0 this year!
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly, the world is not ready for my future shenanigans and goofs. Watch out!
